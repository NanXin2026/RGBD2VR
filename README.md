A Real-time Depth Aided Adaptive Stereo Generation Framework

# RGBD2VR

RGBD2VR is a real-time XR rendering demo that converts RGB-D camera streams into stereoscopic images for Virtual Reality (VR) headsets and 3D displays.

The system captures RGB and depth images from an Orbbec RGB-D camera and processes them using the RGBD2VR depth engine. The algorithm generates a second virtual view based on the depth information and produces a stereoscopic image pair suitable for VR headsets or 3D monitors.

This project demonstrates how RGB-D sensing and computer vision can be combined with VR rendering to create immersive 3D experiences.

# Introduction

Extended Reality (XR), including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), relies heavily on high-quality 3D content generation. Traditional stereoscopic capture requires two cameras with a fixed baseline close to the human pupillary distance (PD). However, this approach is difficult to adapt to different hardware platforms and viewer PD values.

RGB-D cameras provide an alternative approach by capturing both color and depth information. Using depth data, it is possible to synthesize a second viewpoint from a single RGB image. This allows real-time generation of stereoscopic images suitable for XR devices.

The **RGBD2VR engine** implements this concept by converting RGB-D frames into stereo image pairs for XR displays.

The application is implemented using:

- **C++**
- **OpenCV** for image processing and rendering
- **StereoKit** for VR headset integration

# Application Architecture

The RGBD2VR pipeline consists of the following components.
RGB-D Camera
│
│ RGB + Depth Frames
▼
RGBD2VR Algorithm (Depth Engine)
│
│ View synthesis from depth
▼
Stereo Image Pair
│
├── VR Headset (StereoKit)
└── 3D Display (OpenCV rendering)


### RGBD2VR Algorithm

The RGBD2VR algorithm generates a second view image by shifting RGB pixels according to their depth values. This creates a stereoscopic image pair suitable for XR display systems.

Key processing steps:

1. RGB and depth frame acquisition  
2. Depth to RGB registration  
3. Depth-to-disparity conversion  
4. Pixel shifting to generate the second view  
5. Hole filling and rendering

# Project Background

RGBD2VR is part of Orbbec's **UniXR XR content generation framework**.

The system demonstrates how RGB-D cameras can generate stereoscopic XR content in real time without requiring a dual-camera stereoscopic setup.

The technology has been demonstrated in multiple scenarios including:

- VR headset visualization
- 3D monitor displays
- live XR content streaming
- robotics tele-operation visualization

# Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected

Check Windows **Device Manager** to verify the Orbbec camera driver is installed correctly.

---

### Headset not recognized

Open the Oculus Desktop App and confirm the headset appears under **Devices**.

---

### No video in VR

Make sure:

- Quest Link is enabled
- The RGBD2VR application is running
- The camera stream is active
